       _T_e_s_t _S_e_r_v_e_r is a portable test server for automated application
       testing. The server can run test suites on local or remote targets and
       log progress and results to HTML pages. The main purpose of Test Server
       is to act as engine inside customized test tools. A callback interface
       for such framework applications is provided.

       In brief the test server supports:

         * Running multiple, concurrent test suites

         * Running tests on remote and even diskless targets

         * Test suites may contain other test suites, in a tree fashion

         * Logging of the events in a test suite, on both suite and case
           levels

         * HTML presentation of test suite results

         * HTML presentation of test suite code

         * Support for test suite authors, e.g. start/stop slave nodes

         * Call trace on target and slave nodes

       For information about how to write test cases and test suites, please
       see the Test Server User's Guide and the reference manual for the
       _t_e_s_t___s_e_r_v_e_r module.

       _C_o_m_m_o_n _T_e_s_t is an existing test tool application based on the OTP Test
       Server. Please read the Common Test User's Guide for more information.
