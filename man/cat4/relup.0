       relup - Release upgrade file

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The _r_e_l_e_a_s_e _u_p_g_r_a_d_e _f_i_l_e describes how a release is upgraded in a
       running system.

       This file is automatically generated by _s_y_s_t_o_o_l_s_:_m_a_k_e___r_e_l_u_p_/_3_,_4, using
       a release resource file (_._r_e_l), application resource files (_._a_p_p) and
       application upgrade files (_._a_p_p_u_p) as input.

       In a target system, the release upgrade file should be located in the
       _O_T_P___R_O_O_T_/_e_r_t_s_-_E_V_s_n_/_V_s_n directory.

       The _r_e_l_u_p file contains one single Erlang term, which defines the
       instructions used to upgrade the release. The file has the following
       syntax:

       {Vsn,
         [{UpFromVsn, Descr, Instructions}, ...],
         [{DownToVsn, Descr, Instructions}, ...]}.


         * _V_s_n _= _s_t_r_i_n_g_(_) is the current version of the release.

         * _U_p_F_r_o_m_V_s_n _= _s_t_r_i_n_g_(_) is an earlier version of the release to
           upgrade from.

         * _D_e_s_c_r _= _t_e_r_m_(_) is a user defined parameter passed from the
           _s_y_s_t_o_o_l_s_:_m_a_k_e___r_e_l_u_p_/_3_,_4 function. It will be used in the return
           value of _r_e_l_e_a_s_e___h_a_n_d_l_e_r_:_i_n_s_t_a_l_l___r_e_l_e_a_s_e_/_1_,_2.

         * _I_n_s_t_r_u_c_t_i_o_n_s is a list of low-level release upgrade instructions,
           see _a_p_p_u_p_(_4_).

           It consists of the release upgrade instructions from the respective
           application upgrade files (high-level instructions are translated
           to low-level instructions), in the same order as in the start
           script.

         * _D_o_w_n_T_o_V_s_n _= _s_t_r_i_n_g_(_) is an earlier version of the release to
           downgrade to.

       When upgrading from _U_p_F_r_o_m_V_s_n with _r_e_l_e_a_s_e___h_a_n_d_l_e_r_:_i_n_s_t_a_l_l___r_e_l_e_a_s_e_/_1_,_2,
       there does not have to be an exact match of versions, but _U_p_F_r_o_m_V_s_n can
       be a sub-string of the current release version.
