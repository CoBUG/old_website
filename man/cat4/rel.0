       The _r_e_l_e_a_s_e _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e _f_i_l_e specifies which applications are are included
       in a release (system) based on Erlang/OTP.

       This file is used by the functions in _s_y_s_t_o_o_l_s when generating start
       scripts (_._s_c_r_i_p_t, _._b_o_o_t) and release upgrade files (_r_e_l_u_p).

FFIILLEE SSYYNNTTAAXX
       The release resource file should be called _N_a_m_e_._r_e_l.

       The _._r_e_l file contains one single Erlang term, which is called a
       _r_e_l_e_a_s_e _s_p_e_c_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n. The file has the following syntax:

       {release, {RelName,Vsn}, {erts, EVsn},
         [{Application, AppVsn} |
          {Application, AppVsn, Type} |
          {Application, AppVsn, IncApps} |
          {Application, AppVsn, Type, IncApps}]}.


         * _R_e_l_N_a_m_e _= _s_t_r_i_n_g_(_) is the name of the release.

         * _V_s_n _= _s_t_r_i_n_g_(_) is the version of the release.

         * _E_V_s_n _= _s_t_r_i_n_g_(_) is the version of ERTS the release is intended for.

         * _A_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n _= _a_t_o_m_(_) is the name of an application included in the
           release.

         * _A_p_p_V_s_n _= _s_t_r_i_n_g_(_) is the version of an application included in the
           release.

         * _T_y_p_e _= _p_e_r_m_a_n_e_n_t _| _t_r_a_n_s_i_e_n_t _| _t_e_m_p_o_r_a_r_y _| _l_o_a_d _| _n_o_n_e is the start
           type of an application included in the release.

           If _T_y_p_e _= _p_e_r_m_a_n_e_n_t _| _t_r_a_n_s_i_e_n_t _| _t_e_m_p_o_r_a_r_y, the application will
           be loaded and started in the corresponding way, see _a_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_(_3_).
           If _T_y_p_e _= _l_o_a_d, the application will only be loaded. If _T_y_p_e _=
           _n_o_n_e, the application will be neither loaded nor started, although
           the code for its modules will be loaded. Defaults to _p_e_r_m_a_n_e_n_t

         * _I_n_c_A_p_p_s _= _[_a_t_o_m_(_)_] is a list of applications that are included by
           an application included in the release.

           The list must be a subset of the included applications specified in
           the application resource file (_A_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_._a_p_p) and overrides this
           value. Defaults to the same value as in the application resource
           file.

   NNoottee::
       The list of applications must contain the _k_e_r_n_e_l and _s_t_d_l_i_b
       applications.
