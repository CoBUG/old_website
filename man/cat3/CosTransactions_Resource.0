       CosTransactions_Resource - This module implements the OMG
       CosTransactions::Resource interface.

              This operation instructs the Resource to commit all changes made
              as a part of the transaction.

              The Resource can raise:

                * Heuristic Exception - if a Heuristic decision is made which
                  differ from the true outcome of the transaction. The
                  Resource must remember the Heuristic outcome until the
                  _f_o_r_g_e_t operation is performed.

              Types:

                 Resource = #objref

                 #'CosTransactions_TransactionRolledBack'{}

              If possible, the Resource should commit all changes made as part
              of the transaction, else it should raise the
              TRANSACTION_ROLLEDBACK exception. This operation can only be
              used if the Resource is the only child of its parent.

              Types:

                 Resource = #objref
                 Return = ok

              This operation informs the Resource that it is safe to forget
              any Heuristic decisions and the knowledge of the transaction.

       pprreeppaarree((RReessoouurrccee)) -->> RReettuurrnn

              Types:

                 Resource = #objref
                 Return = Vote | {'EXCEPTION', E}
                 Vote = 'VoteReadOnly' | 'VoteCommit' | 'VoteRollback'
                 E = #'CosTransactions_HeuristicMixed'{} |
                 #'CosTransactions_HeuristicHazard'{}

              This operation is invoked on the Resource to begin the two-phase
              commit protocol.

              The Resource can reply:

                * 'VoteReadOnly' - if no persistent data has been modified by
                  the transaction. The Resource can forget all knowledge of
                  the transaction.

                * 'VoteCommit' - if the Resource has been prepared and is able
                  to write all the data needed to commit the transaction to
                  stable storage.

                * 'VoteRollback' - under any circumstances but must do so if
                  none of the alternatives above are applicable.

                * Heuristic Exception - if a Heuristic decision is made which
                  differ from the true outcome of the transaction. The
                  Resource must remember the Heuristic outcome until the
                  _f_o_r_g_e_t operation is performed.

              Types:

                 Resource = #objref
                 Return = ok | {'EXCEPTION', E}
                 E = #'CosTransactions_HeuristicCommit'{} |
                 #'CosTransactions_HeuristicMixed'{} |
                 #'CosTransactions_HeuristicHazard'{}

              This operation instructs the Resource to rollback all changes
              made as a part of the transaction.

              The Resource can raise:

                * Heuristic Exception - if a Heuristic decision is made which
                  differ from the true outcome of the transaction. The
                  Resource must remember the Heuristic outcome until the
                  _f_o_r_g_e_t operation is performed.
