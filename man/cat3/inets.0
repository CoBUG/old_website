       inets - The inets services API

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This module provides the most basic API to the clients and servers,
       that are part of the Inets application, such as start and stop.

              Types:

                 Service = service()
                 Pid = pid()

              Returns a list of currently running services.

              Services started as _s_t_a_n_d___a_l_o_n_e will not be listed.

              Types:

                 Service = service()
                 Pid = pid()
                 Info = [{Option, Value}]
                 Option = property()
                 Value = term()

              Returns a list of currently running services where each service
              is described by a [{Option, Value}] list. The information given
              in the list is specific for each service and it is probable that
              each service will have its own info function that gives you even
              more details about the service.

              Types:

                 Service = service()

              Returns a list of available service names.

              Types:

              Starts the Inets application. Default type is temporary. See

              Types:

                 Service = service()
                 ServiceConfig = [{Option, Value}]

                 Value = term()
                 How = inets | stand_alone - default is inets

              Dynamically starts an inets service after the inets application
              has been started.

          NNoottee::
              Dynamically started services will not be handled by application
              takeover and failover behavior when inets is run as a
              distributed application. Nor will they be automatically
              restarted when the inets application is restarted, but as long
              as the inets application is up and running they will be
              supervised and may be soft code upgraded. Services started as
              _s_t_a_n_d___a_l_o_n_e, e.i. the service is not started as part of the
              inets application, will lose all OTP application benefits such
              as soft upgrade. The "stand_alone-service" will be linked to the
              process that started it. In most cases some of the supervision
              functionality will still be in place and in some sense the
              calling process has now become the top supervisor.

              Types:

                 Service = service() | stand_alone
                 Reference = pid() | term() - service specified reference
                 Reason = term()

              Stops a started service of the inets application or takes down a
              "stand_alone-service" gracefully. When the _s_t_a_n_d___a_l_o_n_e option is
              used in start, only the pid is a valid argument to stop.
