       CosNaming - The CosNaming service is a collection of interfaces that
       together define the naming service.

       The naming service provides the principal mechanism for clients to find
       objects in an ORB based world. The naming service provides an initial
       naming context that functions as the root context for all names. Given
       this context clients can navigate in the name space.

       Types that are declared on the CosNaming level are:

       typedef string Istring;
       struct NameComponent {
             Istring id;
             Istring kind;
       };

       typedef sequence <NameComponent> Name;

       enum BindingType {nobject, ncontext};

       struct Binding {
             Name    binding_name;
             BindingType binding_type;
       };

       typedef sequence <Binding> BindingList;


       To get access to the record definitions for the structs use:
       _-_i_n_c_l_u_d_e___l_i_b_(_"_o_r_b_e_r_/_C_O_S_S_/_C_o_s_N_a_m_i_n_g_._h_r_l_"_)_..

       Names are not an ORB object but the can be structured in components as
       seen by the definition above. There are no requirements on names so the
       service can support many different conventions and standards.

       There are two different interfaces supported in the service:

         * NamingContext

         * BindingIterator
