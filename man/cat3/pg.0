       pg - Distributed, Named Process Groups

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This (experimental) module implements process groups. A process group
       is a group of processes that can be accessed by a common name. For
       example, a group named _f_o_o_b_a_r can include a set of processes as members
       of this group and they can be located on different nodes.

       When messages are sent to the named group, all members of the group
       receive the message. The messages are serialized. If the process _P_1
       sends the message _M_1 to the group, and process _P_2 simultaneously sends
       message _M_2, then all members of the group receive the two messages in
       the same order. If members of a group terminate, they are automatically
       removed from the group.

       This module is not complete. The module is inspired by the ISIS system
       and the causal order protocol of the ISIS system should also be
       implemented. At the moment, all messages are serialized by sending them
       through a group master process.
