       The functions in _s_h_e_l_l___d_e_f_a_u_l_t are called when no module name is given
       in a shell command.

       Consider the following shell dialogue:

       1 > lists:reverse("abc").
       "cba"
       2 > c(foo).
       {ok, foo}

       In command one, the module _l_i_s_t_s is called. In command two, no module
       name is specified. The shell searches the modules _u_s_e_r___d_e_f_a_u_l_t followed
       by _s_h_e_l_l___d_e_f_a_u_l_t for the function _f_o_o_/_1.

       _s_h_e_l_l___d_e_f_a_u_l_t is intended for "system wide" customizations to the
       shell. _u_s_e_r___d_e_f_a_u_l_t is intended for "local" or individual user
       customizations.

       To add your own commands to the shell, create a module called
       _u_s_e_r___d_e_f_a_u_l_t and add the commands you want. Then add the following line
       as the _f_i_r_s_t line in your _._e_r_l_a_n_g file in your home directory.

       code:load_abs("$PATH/user_default").

       _$_P_A_T_H is the directory where your _u_s_e_r___d_e_f_a_u_l_t module can be found.
