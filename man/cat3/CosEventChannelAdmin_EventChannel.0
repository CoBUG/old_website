       CosEventChannelAdmin_EventChannel - This module implements an Event
       Channel interface, which plays the role of a  mediator between
       consumers and suppliers.

       An event channel is an object that allows multiple suppliers to
       communicate with multiple consumers in a highly decoupled, asynchronous
       manner. The event channel is built up incrementally. When an event
       channel is created no suppliers or consumers are connected to it. Event
       Channel can implement group communication by serving as a replicator,
       broadcaster, or multicaster that forward events from one or more
       suppliers to multiple consumers.

       It is up to the user to decide when an event channel is created and how
       references to the event channel are obtained. By representing the event
       channel as an object, it has all of the properties that apply to
       objects. One way to manage an event channel is to register it in a
       naming context, or export it through an operation on an object.

       Any object that possesses an object reference that supports the
       ProxyPullConsumer interface can perform the following operations:

              This operation returns a ConsumerAdmin object reference. If
              ConsumerAdmin object does not exist already it creates one.

              This operation returns a SupplierAdmin object reference. If
              SupplierAdmin object does not exist already it creates one.
