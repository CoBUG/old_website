       heart - Heartbeat Monitoring of an Erlang Runtime System

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This modules contains the interface to the _h_e_a_r_t process. _h_e_a_r_t sends
       periodic heartbeats to an external port program, which is also named
       _h_e_a_r_t. The purpose of the heart port program is to check that the
       Erlang runtime system it is supervising is still running. If the port
       program has not received any heartbeats within _H_E_A_R_T___B_E_A_T___T_I_M_E_O_U_T
       seconds (default is 60 seconds), the system can be rebooted. Also, if
       the system is equipped with a hardware watchdog timer and is running
       Solaris, the watchdog can be used to supervise the entire system.

       An Erlang runtime system to be monitored by a heart program, should be
       started with the command line flag _-_h_e_a_r_t (see also eerrll((11))). The _h_e_a_r_t
       process is then started automatically:

       % erl -heart ...

       If the system should be rebooted because of missing heart-beats, or a
       terminated Erlang runtime system, the environment variable
       _H_E_A_R_T___C_O_M_M_A_N_D has to be set before the system is started. If this
       variable is not set, a warning text will be printed but the system will
       not reboot. However, if the hardware watchdog is used, it will trigger
       a reboot _H_E_A_R_T___B_E_A_T___B_O_O_T___D_E_L_A_Y seconds later nevertheless (default is
       60).

       To reboot on the WINDOWS platform _H_E_A_R_T___C_O_M_M_A_N_D can be set to _h_e_a_r_t
       _-_s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n (included in the Erlang delivery) or of course to any other
       suitable program which can activate a reboot.

       The hardware watchdog will not be started under Solaris if the
       environment variable _H_W___W_D___D_I_S_A_B_L_E is set.

       The _H_E_A_R_T___B_E_A_T___T_I_M_E_O_U_T and _H_E_A_R_T___B_E_A_T___B_O_O_T___D_E_L_A_Y environment variables
       can be used to configure the heart timeouts, they can be set in the
       operating system shell before Erlang is started or be specified at the
       command line:

       % erl -heart -env HEART_BEAT_TIMEOUT 30 ...

       The value (in seconds) must be in the range 10 < X <= 65535.

       It should be noted that if the system clock is adjusted with more than
       _H_E_A_R_T___B_E_A_T___T_I_M_E_O_U_T seconds, _h_e_a_r_t will timeout and try to reboot the
       system. This can happen, for example, if the system clock is adjusted
       automatically by use of NTP (Network Time Protocol).

       In the following descriptions, all function fails with reason _b_a_d_a_r_g if
       _h_e_a_r_t is not started.

              Types:

                 Cmd = string()

              Sets a temporary reboot command. This command is used if a
              _H_E_A_R_T___C_O_M_M_A_N_D other than the one specified with the environment
              variable should be used in order to reboot the system. The new
              Erlang runtime system will (if it misbehaves) use the
              environment variable _H_E_A_R_T___C_O_M_M_A_N_D to reboot.

              Limitations: The length of the _C_m_d command string must be less
              than 2047 characters.

       cclleeaarr__ccmmdd(()) -->> ookk

              Clears the temporary boot command. If the system terminates, the
              normal _H_E_A_R_T___C_O_M_M_A_N_D is used to reboot.

              Types:

              Get the temporary reboot command. If the command is cleared, the
              empty string will be returned.
