       CosEventChannelAdmin_ProxyPushConsumer - This module implements a
       ProxyPushConsumer interface which acts as a middleman between push
       supplier and the event channel.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The ProxyPushConsumer interface defines the second step for connecting
       push suppliers to the event channel. A proxy consumer is similar to a
       normal consumer, but includes an additional method for connecting a
       supplier to the proxy consumer.

       To get access to all definitions, e.g., exceptions, include necessary
       _h_r_l files by using:
       _-_i_n_c_l_u_d_e___l_i_b_(_"_c_o_s_E_v_e_n_t_/_i_n_c_l_u_d_e_/_*_._h_r_l_"_)_.

       Any object that possesses an object reference that supports the
       ProxyPushConsumer interface can perform the following operations:

              Types:

                 Object = #objref
                 PushSupplier = #objref of PushSupplier type
                 Return = ok | {'EXCEPTION',
                 #'CosEventChannelAdmin_AlreadyConnected'{}}

              This operation connects PushSupplier object to the
              ProxyPushConsumer object. A nil object reference can be passed
              to this operation. If so a channel cannot invoke the
              disconnect_push_supplier operation on the supplier; the supplier
              may be disconnected from the channel without being informed. If
              the ProxyPushConsumer is already connected to a PushSupplier,
              then the _C_o_s_E_v_e_n_t_C_h_a_n_n_e_l_A_d_m_i_n___A_l_r_e_a_d_y_C_o_n_n_e_c_t_e_d exception is
              raised.

              This operation disconnects proxy push consumer from the event
              channel. Sends a notification about the loss of the connection
              to the push supplier attached to it, unless nil object reference
              was passed at the connection time.

              This operation sends event data to all connected consumers via
              the event channel. If the event communication has already been
              disconnected, the _C_o_s_E_v_e_n_t_C_o_m_m___D_i_s_c_o_n_n_e_c_t_e_d is raised.
