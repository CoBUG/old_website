       The Pman application has been superseded by the Observer application.
       Pman will be removed in R16.


       A graphical tool used to inspect the Erlang processes executing either
       locally or on remote nodes. It is also possible to trace events in the
       individual processes.

              Types:

                 Excluded = [Module]
                  Module = atom()

              Starts Pman. It will use the previously saved trace settings in
              _H_O_M_E_/_._e_r_l_a_n_g___t_o_o_l_s_/_p_m_a_n_._o_p_t_s, where _H_O_M_E is the user's home
              directory, if such a file exists. Otherwise standard trace
              settings will be used. The return value should be ignored.

              _E_x_c_l_u_d_e_d is a list of module names. If the argument is present,
              processes currently executing in any of these modules will not
              be shown by Pman.

              _s_t_a_r_t_/_0_,_1 will fail unless the start-up succeeds within 20
              seconds, whereas _s_t_a_r_t___n_o_t_i_m_e_o_u_t_/_0_,_1 will wait indefinitely.

       pprroocc((AA,, BB,, CC))

              Types:

                 Process = pid() | atom()
                 A = B = C = integer()

              Starts a Pman trace window for the specified process. The return
              value should be ignored.

              The process to trace is given either by its pid or by its
              registered name. It is also possible to use _p_r_o_c_/_3 to trace the
              pid represented as _<_A_,_B_,_C_>.
