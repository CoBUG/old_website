       The TV application has been superseded by the Observer application. TV
       will be removed in R16.


       TV enables the user to examine ETS and Mnesia tables. Once a certain
       table has been opened in the tool, the content may be viewed at various
       levels of detail. The content viewed may also be sorted, using any
       element as key. The table may be polled anytime; either regularly at
       specified intervals, or manually. New and deleted objects, as well as
       those altered, are marked with characteristic colors.
