       werl - The Erlang Emulator

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       On Windows, the preferred way to start the Erlang system for
       interactive use is:

       _w_e_r_l _<_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s_>

       This will start Erlang in its own window, with fully functioning
       command-line editing and scrollbars. All flags except _-_o_l_d_s_h_e_l_l work as
       they do for the eerrll command.

       Ctrl-C is reserved for copying text to the clipboard (Ctrl-V to paste).
       To interrupt the runtime system or the shell process (depending on what
       has been specified with the +B system flag), you should use Ctrl-Break.

       In cases where you want to redirect standard input and/or standard
       output or use Erlang in a pipeline, the _w_e_r_l is not suitable, and the
       _e_r_l program should be used instead.

       The _w_e_r_l window is in many ways modelled after the _x_t_e_r_m window present
       on other platforms, as the _x_t_e_r_m model fits well with line oriented
       command based interaction. This means that selecting text is line
       oriented rather than rectangle oriented.

       To select text in the _w_e_r_l window , simply press and hold the left
       mouse button and drag the mouse over the text you want to select. If
       the selection crosses line boundaries, the selected text will consist
       of complete lines where applicable (just like in a word processor). To
       select more text than fits in the window, start by selecting a small
       portion in the beginning of the text you want, then use the scrollbar
       to view the end of the desired selection, point to it and press the
       _r_i_g_h_t mouse-button. The whole area between your first selection and the
       point where you right-clicked will be included in the selection.

       The selected text is copied to the clipboard by either pressing _C_t_r_l_-_C,
       using the menu or pressing the copy button in the toolbar.

       Pasted text is always inserted at the current prompt position and will
       be interpreted by Erlang as usual keyboard input.

       Previous command lines can be retrieved by pressing the _U_p _a_r_r_o_w or by
       pressing _C_t_r_l_-_P. There is also a drop down box in the toolbar
       containing the command history. Selecting a command in the drop down
       box will insert it at the prompt, just as if you used the keyboard to
       retrieve the command.

       Closing the _w_e_r_l window will stop the Erlang emulator.
