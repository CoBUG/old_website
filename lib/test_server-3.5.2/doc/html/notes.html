    <h4>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    The documentation has been updated with the latest
	    changes for the test_server_ctrl:report/2 function.</p>

	    Own Id: OTP-10086 Aux Id: seq12066 </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    The ct:get_status/0 function failed to report status if a
	    parallel test case group was running at the time of the
	    call. This has been fixed and the return value for the
	    function has been updated. Please see the ct reference
	    manual for details.</p>

    <h4>Improvements and New Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    It is now possible to sort the HTML tables by clicking on
	    the header elements. In order to reset a sorted table,
	    the browser window should simply be refreshed. This
	    feature requires that the browser supports javascript,
	    and has javascript execution enabled. If the 'ct_run
	    -basic_html' flag is used, no javascript code is included
	    in the generated HTML code.</p>

	    Own Id: OTP-9896 Aux Id: seq12034, OTP-9835 </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Verbosity levels for log printouts has been added. This
	    makes it possible to specify preferred verbosity for
	    different categories of log printouts, as well as general
	    printouts (such as standard IO), to allow control over
	    which strings get printed and which get ignored. New
	    versions of the Common Test logging functions, ct:log,
	    ct:pal and ct:print, have been introduced, with a new
	    Importance argument added. The Importance value is
	    compared to the verbosity level at runtime. More
	    information can be found in the chapter about Logging in
	    the Common Test User's Guide.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    The Erlang/OTP test runner ts has been extended to allow
	    cross compilation of test suites. To cross compile the
	    test suites first follow the normal cross compilation
	    procedures and release the tests on the build host. Then
	    install ts using an xcomp specification file and compile
	    test suites using ts:compile_testcases/0. For more
	    details see $ERL_TOP/xcomp/README.md.</p>

<h3><a name="id63496">1.2 
        Test_Server 3.5.1</a></h3>

    <h4>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    After a test case timeout or abortion, the
	    end_per_testcase function executes on a new dedicated
	    process. The group leader for this process should be set
	    to the IO server for the test case, which was not done
	    properly. The result of this error was that no warnings
	    about end_per_testcase failing or timing out were ever
	    printed in the test case log. Also, help functions such
	    as e.g. test_server:stop_node/1, attempting to
	    synchronize with the IO server, would hang. The fault has
	    been corrected.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-9666</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    A deadlock situation could occur if Common Test is
	    forwarding error_handler printouts to Test Server at the
	    same time a new test case is starting. This error has
	    been fixed.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-9894</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    When a test case was killed because of a timetrap
	    timeout, the current location (suite, case and line) was
	    not printed correctly in the log files. This has been
	    corrected.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-9930 Aux Id: seq12002 </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Test Server and Common Test would add new error handlers
	    with each test run and fail to remove previously added
	    ones. In the case of Test Server, this would only happen
	    if SASL was not running on the test node. This has been
	    fixed.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-9941 Aux Id: seq12009 </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    If a test case process was terminated due to an exit
	    signal from a linked process, Test Server failed to
	    report the correct name of the suite and case to the
	    framework. This has been corrected.</p>

    <h4>Improvements and New Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    A new optional feature has been introduced that enables
	    Common Test to generate priv_dir directory names that are
	    unique for each test case or config function. The name of
	    the option/flag is 'create_priv_dir' and it can be set to
	    value 'auto_per_run' (which is the default, existing,
	    behaviour), or 'auto_per_tc' or 'manual_per_tc'. If
	    'auto_per_tc' is used, Test Server creates a dedicated
	    priv_dir automatically for each test case (which can be
	    very expensive in case of many and/or repeated cases). If
	    'manual_per_tc' is used, the user needs to create the
	    priv_dir explicitly by calling the new function
	    ct:make_priv_dir/0.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-9659 Aux Id: seq11930 </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    A column for test case group name has been added to the
	    suite overview HTML log file.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-9730 Aux Id: seq11952 </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    It is now possible to use the post_end_per_testcase CT
	    hook function to print a comment for a test case in the
	    overview log file, even if the test case gets killed by a
	    timetrap or unknown exit signal, or if the
	    end_per_testcase function times out.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-9855 Aux Id: seq11979 </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Common Test will now print error information (with a time
	    stamp) in the test case log file immediately when a test
	    case fails. This makes it easier to see when, in time,
	    the fault actually occured, and aid the job of locating
	    relevant trace and debug printouts in the log.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-9904 Aux Id: seq11985, OTP-9900 </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    Test Server has been modified to check the SASL
	    errlog_type parameter when receiving an error logger
	    event, so that it doesn't print reports of type that the
	    user has disabled.</p>
          <p>

        </li>
        <li>

	    If an application cannot be found by ts it is
	    automatically skipped when testing.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-9971</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    By specifying a user defined function ({M,F,A} or fun) as
	    timetrap value, either by means of an info function or by
	    calling ct:timetrap/1, it is now possible to set a
	    timetrap that will be triggered when the user function
	    returns.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-9988 Aux Id: OTP-9501, seq11894 </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    If the optional configuration functions init_per_suite/1
	    and end_per_suite/1 are not implemented in the test
	    suite, local Common Test versions of these functions are
	    called instead, and will be displayed in the overview log
	    file. Any printouts made by the pre- or
	    post_init_per_suite and pre- or post_end_per_suite hook
	    functions are saved in the log files for these functions.</p>

<h3><a name="id60376">1.3 
        Test_Server 3.5</a></h3>

    <h4>Improvements and New Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    The test case group info function has been implemented in
	    Common Test. Before execution of a test case group, a
	    call is now made to <span class="code">TestSuite:group(GroupName)</span>.
	    The function returns a list of test properties, e.g. to
	    specify timetrap values, require configuration data, etc
	    (analogue to the test suite- and test case info
	    function). The scope of the properties set by
	    <span class="code">group(GroupName)</span> is all test cases and sub-groups
	    of group <span class="code">GroupName</span>.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-9235</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    The look of the HTML log files generated by Common Test
	    and Test Server has been improved (and made easier to
	    customize) by means of a CSS file.</p>

          <p>
	    An error in how comments are colored in the test suite
	    overview html log file has been corrected. As result, a
	    new framework callback function, format_comment/1, has
	    been introduced.</p>

        <li>
          <p>
	    Test Server did not release SASL TTY handlers
	    (sasl_report_tty_h and error_logger_tty_h) properly after
	    each test run. This error has been fixed.</p>

	    Own Id: OTP-9369</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    If ct:log/2 was called with bad arguments, this could

	    A bug has been fixed that made Test Server call the
	    end_tc/3 framework function with an incorrect module name
	    as first argument.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-9379 Aux Id: seq11863 </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
	    If end_per_testcase caused a timetrap timeout, the actual
	    test case status was discarded and the test case logged
	    as successful (even if the case had actually failed
	    before the call to end_per_testcase). This fault has been
	    fixed.</p>

        <li>
          <p>
	    If a timetrap timeout occured during execution of of a
	    function in a lib module (i.e. a function called directly
	    or indirectly from a test case), the Suite argument in
	    the end_tc/3 framework callback function would not
	    correctly contain the name of the test suite, but the lib
	    module. (This would only happen if the lib module was
	    compiled with ct.hrl included). This error has been
	    solved.</p>

	    Add a proplist() type</p>
          <p>
	    Recently I was adding specs to an API and found that

	    If a test suite would start with a test case group
	    defined without the init_per_group/2 and end_per_group/2
	    function, init_per_suite/1 would not execute initially
	    and logging of the test run would fail. This error has

    <h4>Improvements and New Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
	    A new option, 'logopts', has been introduced, to make it
	    possible to modify some aspects of the logging behaviour
	    in Common Test (or Test Server). For example, whenever an
	    io printout is made, test_server adds newline (\n) to the
	    end of the output string. This may not always be a
	    preferred action and can therefore be disabled by means
	    of "ct_run ... -logopts no_nl" (or ct:run_test([...,
	    {logopts,[no_nl]}])). A new framework callback function,
	    get_logopts/0, has been introduced (see the ct_framework

	    A new option, 'logopts', has been introduced, to make it
	    possible to modify some aspects of the logging behaviour
	    in Common Test (or Test Server). For example, if the html
	    version of the test suite source code should not be
	    generated during the test run (and consequently be
	    unavailable in the log file system), the feature may be
	    disabled by means of "ct_run ... -logopts no_src" (or
	    ct:run_test([..., {logopts,[no_src]}])). A new framework
	    callback function, get_logopts/0, has been introduced
	    (see the ct_framework module for details).</p>

	    When running tests with auto-compilation disabled, Common
	    Test could only display the test suite source code on
	    html format in the test case log if the source file was
	    located in the same directory as the pre-compiled suite.
	    This has been modified so that Common Test now tries to
	    locate the source file by means of the test suite module
	    info (Suite:module_info/1). As a result, a suite may now
	    be compiled to a different output directory (e.g.
	    $MYTEST/bin) than the source code directory (e.g.
	    $MYTEST/src), without the source-code-to-html generation

	    runtime failure, test_server failed to format the line
	    number information properly and crashed. This error has
	    now been fixed.</p>

	    Test Server is a portable test server for automated
	    application testing. The server can run test suites on
	    local or remote targets and log progress and results to
	    HTML pages. The main purpose of Test Server is to act as
	    engine inside customized test tools. A callback interface
	    for such framework applications is provided.</p>
