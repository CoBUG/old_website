    <div class="warning">
<div class="label">Warning</div>
<div class="content"><p>
      <p>
	The Appmon application has been superseded by the Observer application.
	Appmon will be removed in R16.
      </p>
    </p></div>
</div>
    <p>The application monitor Appmon is a graphical node and application viewer. The tool shows an overview of all applications on all known nodes, and it is possible to view the process tree for an application running on any of the nodes.</p>
    <div class="note">
<div class="label">Note</div>
<div class="content"><p>
      <p>If the Appmon code is not available at a node, for example an
        embedded node, this node is ignored by Appmon and is not shown
        in the Appmon window.</p>
    </p></div>
</div>
  

  <h3><a name="id61097">1.2 
        Getting Started with Appmon</a></h3>
    
    <p>Start Appmon by calling <span class="code">appmon:start()</span>. It will start the <span class="bold_code"><a href="#main_win">main window</a></span> showing a load meter and the applications running at the current node. By clicking on one of the applications a window showing the process tree of the application will be opened, the <span class="bold_code"><a href="#app_win">application window</a></span>.</p>
    <p>The main window is equipped with a menubar from which it is possible to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>exit Appmon</li>
      <li>perform some operations on the node</li>
      <li>set how information should be displayed</li>
      <li>select which node to show</li>
      <li>open help (this document).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The application window shows the process tree for an application with each process displayed as a box. It is possible to view information about the processes, to send messages to them, and to trace and kill them.</p>
  

  <h3><a name="id61061">1.3 
        The Main Window</a></h3>
    
    <a name="main_win"></a>
    <p>The main window shows a load meter and all applications running at the displayed node. Select which node to display in the window by choosing the node name from the Nodes menu. It is also possible to run Appmon in a many-window mode where a new instance of the main window is opened for each node to be displayed.</p>

  <h3><a name="id56941">1.7 
        Using the Web Based version of Appmon</a></h3>
    

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
      
      <p>The web based version of Appmon is an alternative version of 
        Appmon. The main difference between the web based version of
        Appmon and the original version of Appmon is that the web based
        version of Appmon can monitor nodes and applications on nodes where
        Appmon not is installed.</p>
    

    <h4>Start the Web Based version of Appmon</h4>
      
      <p>To start the web based user interface configure and start 
        WebTool, see <strong>WebTool User's Guide</strong>. The web based 
        version of Appmon is compatible with the browsers 
        Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer 4.0 and higher.</p>
      <p>When WebTool is started, start the Web based version of Appmon via 
        WebTool. If WebTool succeeded to start the web based version of Appmon 
        a link named WebAppmon will appear in the topmost frame. Click on the link and
        the main frame of the browser will show two frames.The left frame will 
        show a combo box for node selection and a list of all applications on 
        the currently selected node.   </p>
      <p>In the left frame it is possible to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select which node to supervise.</li>
        <li>Select an application to view its process tree.</li>
        <li>Select an application to view its specification.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The right frame shows the selected information, either the application 
        specification or the process tree and process information.</p>
    

    <h4>Selecting a Different Node</h4>
      
      <p>In the top of the left frame there is a combo box with all known 
        nodes. The name of the node that is monitored is the node whose name 
        is visible in the combo box. At startup the node on which the web 
        based version of Appmon is running on will be monitored.</p>
      <p>To change node, select another node in the combo box, and
        the list of running applications will change to the applications
        that runs on the selected node.</p>
    

    <h4>Viewing the Process Tree of an Application</h4>
      
      <p>To view the process tree of an application click on the application 
        name in the list of applications. The process tree of the selected 
        application will then appear in the right frame.</p>
      <p>The processes in the process tree can have three different colors:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong><strong>Blue</strong></strong></dt>
        <dd>The relation to the process above in the process hierarchy 
         is a primary relation. That means that the process above is the
         only process that link to it or the process above is a supervisor. </dd>
        <dt><strong><strong>Red</strong></strong></dt>
        <dd>The relation to the process above in the process hierarchy is a secondary 
         relation. This means that more than one process has a relation to it 
         and the process above in the hierarchy is not a supervisor.</dd>
        <dt><strong><strong>Black</strong></strong></dt>
        <dd>The process isn't a regular process instead it's a Port. The name of 
         the process will also begin with <strong>Port:</strong>
</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>If the process name begins with <strong>Runs on another node:</strong> The 
        monitored application runs on more than one node and this process is 
        the first process on a branch that runs on another node. </p>
    

    <h4>Viewing the Application Specification</h4>
      
      <p>After the application name in the list of applications there are a 
        link named <strong>Spec</strong>, Click on this link and the application 
        specification will appear in the right frame. The application 
        specification is the data in the <strong>.app</strong> file of the selected
        application. </p>
    

    <h4>Select Process View</h4>
      
      <p>In the top of the page that shows the process tree, there are three 
        radio buttons for selecting which processes that shall be included 
        in the process tree. The default mode is that all processes 
        that one process in the application tree  has a relation to is 
        included. It's possible to filter which of the processes 
        in the process tree that will be included. To reduce the number 
        of processes in the process tree select one of the radio buttons 
        on the top of the page </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong><strong>All processes</strong></strong></dt>
        <dd>All processes that at least one process in the application 
         tree has a link to.</dd>
        <dt><strong><strong>Supervised processes</strong></strong></dt>
        <dd>All processes that are supervised by one of the supervisors in 
         the application</dd>
        <dt><strong><strong>Supervisors only</strong></strong></dt>
        <dd>Only the processes that actually are supervisors in the 
         applications supervision tree is included</dd>
      </dl>
    

    <h4>Process Information</h4>
      <a name="proc_info"></a>
      
      <p>To see more information about a specific process  click on the process
        name and more information will be loaded under the application tree.</p>
      <p>The Process information page shows information about a process as given 
        by the <span class="code">process_info(Pid)</span>, but formatted in a more human readable form.</p>
    

    <h4>Trace a process</h4>
      
      <p>If the link after the process name in the process tree is <strong>start trace</strong>
        the process is not traced. If the link is <strong>stop trace</strong> then the process
        id traced.</p>
      <p>To toggle the trace flag for a process click on the link <strong>start trace</strong> or
        <strong>stop trace</strong> after the process name in the process tree.</p>
